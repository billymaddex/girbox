Gnome Utility for the PS3IR-1000 box

It's a pretty slick IR to Bluetooth interface box for the PS3! Sadly, no longer manufactured or really supported. They never got around to making anything other than a Windows program to interface with the box, and I'm done dual booting to run just 1 program. So I threw this little deal together. It does what I need, but is a bit short of feature complete. All the same, thought I might share it with the world. 

PS. You can still check out the what's left of the company website for more info:

Dependencies:
GTK-3
Glade

Should be able to build by just running make, assuming build time dependencies are met.
